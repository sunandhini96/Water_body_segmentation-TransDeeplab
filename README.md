# TransDeeplab Model

# Task : Water Body Segmentation using Trans DeepLab model.

This project implements water body segmentation using the Trans DeepLab model. It includes code for training the model, evaluating its performance, and metrics calculations.

## Files Required:

- `model.py`: TransDeepLab model
- `training.ipynb`: Training the model code
- `evaluation.py`: Model evaluation code
- `transdeeplab and deeplab comparision.ipynb`: Comparision of trans deeplab and convolution based deeplab models.

## Installation:

git clone https://github.com/sunandhini96/Water_body_segmentation-TransDeeplab.git

cd Water_body_segmentation-TransDeeplab


## Usage:

### Run the training script to train the model:
   
run the training.ipynb 

### To evaluate the trained model:

python evaluation.py

## Dataset:

The project uses RGB satellite images and corresponding masks from Sentinel-2 A/B satellite. You can obtain the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/franciscoescobar/satellite-images-of-water-bodies
